A Reactor implementation in Chisel3
=======================

This repo contains the work-in-progress of implementing Reactors in Chisel3.
Reactors are a model of computation (MoC) developed for designing concurrent cyber-physical system.
It has many similarities with the Discrete-Time MoC underlying HDLs such as VHDL, Verilog and SystemC.
Two synthesizable subsets of the Reactor MoC are identified and implemented here.

reactor-chisel is intended as a target for doing HW/SW codesign in the Lingua Franca framework.
